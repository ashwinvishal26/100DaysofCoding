## Blockly Maze Completion
After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? 
Cut and paste and assign it to the variable level_10_code.

How many blocks did you have left? 
Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.
```
level_10_code = ("https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en&level=10&skin=0#82ynwk")
remaining_blocks = ("0")
print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)
print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)

```
